# RedVelvetCake
Hello everyone today I am going to make Red Velvet Cake.....
Red Velvet Cake is traditionally a red, red-brown, crimson or scarlet-colored chocolate layer cake, layered with ermine icing..
It is made with cocoa powder , flour , vinegar , butter and buttermilk. It is fully loaded with creamy and sugery goodness..
Its flavour is little chocolaty and the main flavour actually comes from the cream cheese frosting...
So lets get started with the recipe.......:)
